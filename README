DESCRIPTION
The mappings, command and operator provided by this plugin search a range or
the entire buffer for a pattern (defaulting to the current search pattern),
and print a summary of the number of occurrences above, below and on the
current line, e.g.: 
    1 match after cursor in this line, 8 following, 2 in previous lines; total 10 for /\<SearchPosition\>/ 
    5 matches in this fold, 9 before, 6 following; total 21 for /endif/ 
    On sole match in this line, 40 in following lines for /let/ 
    :144,172 7 matches in this fold for /let/ 

This provides better orientation in a buffer without having to first jump from
search result to search result. 

MOTIVATION
In its simplest implementation
    :nnoremap <A-n> :%s///gn<CR>
    41 matches on 17 lines
prints the number of matches for the current search pattern. This plugin
builds on top of this by providing more context with regards to the current
cursor position plus additional information. 

This plugin is similar to IndexedSearch.vim (vimscript#1682) by Yakov
Lerner. 

USAGE
:[range]SearchPosition [{pattern}]
			Show position of the search results for {pattern} (or
			the current search pattern (@/) if {pattern} is
			omitted). All lines in [range] (or the entire buffer
			if omitted) are considered, and the number of matches
			in relation to the current cursor position is echoed
			to the command line. 

<Leader><A-n>{motion}	Show position for the current search pattern in the
			lines covered by {motion}. 
[count]<A-n>		Show position for the current search pattern in the
			entire buffer, or [count] following lines. 
{Visual}<A-n>		Show position for the current search pattern in the
			selected lines. 

[count]<A-m>		Show position for the whole word under the cursor in the
			entire buffer, or [count] following lines. 
			Only whole keywords are searched for, like with the
			|star| command. 
[count]g<A-m>		Show position for the word under the cursor in the
			entire buffer, or [count] following lines. 
			Also finds contained matches, like |gstar|. 
{Visual}<A-m>		Show position for the selected text in the entire
			buffer.
